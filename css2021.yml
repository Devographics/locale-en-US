    t: The 2021 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the CSS ecosystem.

  - key: introduction.css2021
    t: |

      <span class="first-letter">D</span>o woodworkers have to learn a new, better way to saw a board every couple years? Do painters feel like frauds for still using oil paint? Or is it just us front-end developers who get to experience this constant state of change?

      With container queries and more just around the corner, things are definitely moving fast. And since we need to keep up as well, we took the time to give these survey results a couple new power-ups of their own! 

      What this means in practice is that we can now cross-reference two datapoints, such as yearly salaries by experience level; or gender by country. You'll see some of these breakdowns included throughout the results, but we encourage you to explore the data further using [our API](https://api.stateofjs.com/) or by [downloading our data](https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-css). Let us know if you end up making your own data visualizations!

      And now, let's see what CSS has been up to this year!

      *Note: We've had to push back the 2021 [State of JavaScript](http://stateofjs.com/) survey to January 2022 for lack of time. See you after the holidays!*

      ## Support the Survey With the State of CSS T-Shirt

      Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes. 

      But now, thanks to the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen you can enjoy all this retro radness while also celebrating your love for CSS at the same time!

      This year's survey reached **8,714** developers throughout the world, and in order

    t: |
      <span class="first-line">The way you write CSS is about to change forever</span>

      For many years now, many innovations in writing styles for the web have happened elsewhere: in preprocessors, JavaScript frameworks, or compilers. To be sure, CSS itself has also received some welcome improvements like [aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) or [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). Yet we still reach for libraries and other helpers on a daily basis. 

      But there's a change coming. The core CSS language is getting shaken up and renewed, and we're right at the forefront of accelerated evolution. 

      [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) will bring in an entirely new era of responsive design, and [Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) will make our use of frameworks, theming and managing complex codebases significantly easier. 

      When we look a little further ahead, we can also see the [@when/else conditional](https://css-tricks.com/proposal-for-css-when/) coming up, which will let us combine media, container and supports queries into a single at-rule.

      And fingers crossed, 2022 is the year we finally see some movement on native CSS nesting. Those of us that work with tools like Sass and PostCSS already couldn't imagine another way of working.

      All of this together means that 2022 is likely to be a year where the way you write CSS is going to fundamentally change. It's an incredibly exciting period, and we look forward to all the amazing implementations in the year to come.

  # FAQ/About
  ###########################################################################

  - key: about.content
    t: >
      The 2021 State of CSS survey ran from October 5 to November 2 2021, and collected 8714 responses. The survey is run by me, [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 


      This year's logo and t-shirt were designed and animated by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).

      ### Survey Goals

      This survey, along with the [State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/) survey, was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 


      As such, these surveys are focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 

      ### Survey Design

      The survey was designed in part based on last year's survey, with an open feedback period where the survey outline was discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/StateOfJS/StateOfCSS-2020/issues/8). 

      All survey questions were optional. 

      ### Survey Audience

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

      ### Representativeness & Inclusivity

      While we believe it's important to give a voice to every community, the reality is that an open survey like this one will always struggle to properly represent everybody, especially when operating through systems that already carry their own inherent biases. 


      In order to counter-balance this, we are implementing three distinct strategies:


      - **Outreach**: this year, we reached out to 23 organizations representing BIPOC and LGBTQ developers in the hopes of partnering up. While very few of them replied, we will keep looking for ways to reach out beyond our current audience.

      - **Data Analysis**: through features like facets and variants, we're always trying to make it easier to surface the voices of any demographic segment, no matter how minoritized it might be in our data. 

      - **Barrier Lowering**: making the survey too long, inaccessible, slow to load, English-only, etc. can all contribute to imposing an "effort tax" that cuts off the parts of the community that can't afford to pay it. Fixing these issues can lower the barrier to entry and in the process make our audience more diverse. 

      ### Project Funding

      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:


      - **T-shirt sales**. 

      - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

      - **Other Funding**: this year, the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a small budget to help hire an [accessibility consultant](https://fossheim.io/) to work on the survey.


      Despite these funding sources, the surveys remains mostly a self-funded project overall and any contribution or sponsorship would be greatly appreciated. I would especially like to work closely with more browser vendors, since they play such a central role in the web ecosystem.  

      ### Technical Overview

      You can find a more in-depth technical overview of how the surveys are run [here](https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-the-state-of-js-css-surveys-are-run-4lnb).

      - **Data collection**: custom [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org/) app.

      - **Data storage/processing**: MongoDB & MongoDB Aggregations.

      - **Data API**: Node.js GraphQL API. 

      - **Results Site**: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) React app.

      - **Data Visualizations**: [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) React dataviz library. 

      - **Type**: [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) and [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue).
