            <span class="first-letter">D</span>o woodworkers have to learn a new, better way to saw a board every couple years? Do painters feel like frauds for still using oil paint? Or is it just us front-end developers who get to experience this constant state of change?

            With container queries and more just around the corner, things are definitely moving fast. And since we need to keep up with as well, we took the time to give these survey results a couple new power-ups of their own! 

            What this means in practice is that we can now cross-reference two datapoints, such as yearly salaries by experience level; or gender by country. You'll see some of these breakdowns included throughout the results, but we encourage you to explore the data further using [our API](https://api.stateofjs.com/) or by [downloading our data](https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-css). Let us know if you end up making your own data visualizations!

            And now, let's see what CSS has been up to this year!

            *Note: We've had to push back the 2021 [State of JavaScript](http://stateofjs.com/) survey to January 2022 for lack of time. See you after the holidays!*

          Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes. 

          But now, thanks to the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen you can enjoy all this retro radness while also celebrating your love for CSS at the same time!

            <span class="first-line">The way you write CSS is about to change forever.</span>
            
            For many years now, many innovations in writing styles for the web have happened elsewhere: in preprocessors, JavaScript frameworks, or compilers. To be sure, CSS itself has also received some welcome improvements like [aspect-ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) or [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*). Yet we still reach for libraries and other helpers on a daily basis. 

            But there's a change coming. The core CSS language is getting shaken up and renewed, and we're right at the forefront of accelerated evolution. 

            [Container Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) will bring in an entirely new era of responsive design, and [Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) will make our use of frameworks, theming and managing complex codebases significantly easier. 

            When we look a little further ahead, we can also see the [@when/else conditional](https://css-tricks.com/proposal-for-css-when/) coming up, which will let us combine media, container and supports queries into a single at-rule.

            And fingers crossed, 2022 is the year we finally see some movement on native CSS nesting. Those of us that work with tools like Sass and PostCSS already couldn't imagine another way of working.

            All of this together means that 2022 is likely to be a year where the way you write CSS is going to fundamentally change. It's an incredibly exciting period, and we look forward to all the amazing implementations in the year to come.
