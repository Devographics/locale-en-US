      <span class="first-letter">A</span> lot happened in 2021. So much in fact that the survey was pushed back all the way to 2022!


      Between a slew of faster build tools and a new crop of back-end frameworks, the JavaScript world kept evolving. And we did our best to keep up, giving this survey a couple new power-ups ([read more about what's new](https://dev.to/sachagreif/whats-new-in-the-2021-state-of-javascript-survey-4eej)) such as new question types, the ability to cross-reference two datapoints (such as yearly salaries by experience level), and even a way to customize the charts to surface your own insights! Read more about [what's new this year](https://dev.to/sachagreif/whats-new-in-the-2021-state-of-javascript-survey-4eej) (English).


      It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. We had to deal with a [data leak](https://dev.to/sachagreif/disclosing-a-state-of-javascriptstate-of-css-data-breach-2lg1) that thankfully didn't seem to have any bad consequences. And we're constantly making efforts to make the survey more inclusive, more accessible, and more fair.


      Still, even though the survey can ever only represents a tiny, tiny part of the JavaScript ecosystem, we hope you'll find the resulting data interesting!

      ## Support the Survey With the State of JavaScript T-Shirt

      Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes.

      But now, thanks to the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen you can enjoy all this retro radness while also celebrating your love for JavaScript at the same time!

      This year, **16,085** respondents took part in the survey. And in order
      to help highlight different voices and surface deeper insights, we made a special
      effort to provide new ways to break our data down.

      JavaScript may move fast, but it seems like JavaScript developers move even faster, as many relatively new features already show high adoption levels.

      This year's results point to a high degree of fragmentation in the JavaScript world. But while this can sometimes cause headaches, all that competition does make for a very dynamic ecosystem.

      Picking a technology can often come down to a series of tough choices between

    #Conclusion
    ###########################################################################
    key: sections.conclusion.description
    t: |

      <span class="first-line">JavaScript is in a tremendously better state today compared to 2016.</span>

      Back when the first State of JS survey took place, only 21% of you used TypeScript compared to 69% today. Whereas we used to joke about a new front end framework releasing every day, **React** and **Vue** have now been dominant for 6 years running. And the percentage of people reporting that "JS is moving too fast" is down from 59% to 38%.

      This is not to say that the language has stood still. The **Optional Chaining** and **Nullish Coalescing** APIs have rocketed up to be the most used new APIs in our survey, despite only being 2 years old. And more good things are on the way from TC39: you reported that date management is a top missing feature, and the Temporal API recently reached [Stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal).

      The tooling ecosystem is also seeing its own rapid evolution, and it's fair to say that 2021 has been the year of **Vite**. Vite not only debuted at 98% satisfaction, but usage is already at 30% in its first year on our survey, even eclipsing esbuild. Vite isn't alone in trying to improve the state of JavaScript build tools - 8 of the 12 tools we track today are less than two years old! And while **pnpm**, **Turborepo**, and **Nx** took the top spots in our first year tracking monorepo tooling, only 25% report being happy with the state of that category, showing that a lot of work remains to be done.

      Also notable: many new entrants like **Deno**, **Rome**, **Astro**, **Remix**, and more are now supported by venture-backed companies, perhaps charting a viable alternative to the fragile open-source funding environment.

      As the [Third Age of JavaScript](https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/) enters its third year, the opportunities for aspiring open sourcerors and entrepreneurs continue to unfold, and I'm excited to see what the next couple years bring!

    key: about.content
    t: >
      The 2021 State of JS survey ran from January 13 to February 2 **2022**, and collected 16,085 responses. The survey is run by me, [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants.
      This year's logo and t-shirt were designed by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).
      ### Survey Goals
      This survey, along with the [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/) survey, was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices.
      As such, these surveys are focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included.
      They should also be taken as a **snapshot of a specific subset of developers**, and are not meant to speak for the entire ecosystem.
      ### Survey Design
      The survey was designed in part based on last year's survey, with an open feedback period where the survey outline was discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/StateOfJS/Monorepo/issues/56).
      All survey questions were optional.
      ### Survey Audience
      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic.
      Note that frameworks, libraries, etc. were free to encourage their audience to participate in the survey and some of them did take advantage of this via banners, tweets, etc. A detailed breakdown of traffic sources is included in the "Sources" chart.
      ### Representativeness & Inclusivity
      While we believe it's important to give a voice to every community, the reality is that an open survey like this one will always struggle to properly represent everybody, especially when operating through systems that already carry their own inherent biases.

      In order to counter-balance this, we are implementing three distinct strategies:

      - **Outreach**: we always try to reach out to different organizations (such as BIPOC- or LGBTQ-focused organizations, or online teaching platforms) to try and diversify our own audience.
      - **Data Analysis**: through features like facets and variants, we're always trying to make it easier to surface the voices of any demographic segment, no matter how minoritized it might be in our data.
      - **Barrier Lowering**: making the survey too long, inaccessible, slow to load, English-only, etc. can all contribute to imposing an "effort tax" that cuts off the parts of the community that can't afford to pay it. Fixing these issues can lower the barrier to entry and in the process make our audience more diverse.
      ### Project Funding
      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - **T-shirt sales**.
      - **Chart Sponsorships**: members of the community can donate to the survey in exchange for having their name featured in the report.
      - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).
      - **Other Funding**: this year, the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a small budget to help hire an [accessibility consultant](https://fossheim.io/) to work on the CSS and JS surveys.

      Despite these funding sources, the surveys remains mostly a self-funded project overall and any contribution or sponsorship would be greatly appreciated. I would especially like to work closely with more browser vendors, since they play such a central role in the web ecosystem.
      ### Technical Overview

      - **Results Site**: [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) React app.
