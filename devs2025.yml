      2025 is a weird time to be a developer. AI is changing the way we work, we're dealing with mass layoffs, and there's an ongoing political vibe shift in some corners of the tech community. 

      So while asking about your favorite JavaScript framework over and over again is all well and good, we thought it was time to take on the bigger questions to help make sense of the current moment: who are you? what do you do besides coding? and what do you believe and hope for?

      Welcome to this first ever State of Devs survey, where we ask about everything that's *not* code. 

      As usual, every question is optional, so feel free to skip any that you don't feel comfortable answering. Also please note that the resulting dataset will be made available publicly. All that being said we certainly hope you'll see value in this survey, and we can't wait to get to know you better!

      “These questions feel really personal”. ”This is going to be too controversial”. “You should stick to programming surveys”.

      This is some of the initial feedback I got when I first floated the idea of running a developer survey entirely dedicated to workplace issues, health, hobbies, and other topics unrelated to code. 

      Yet I'm glad I went ahead. This survey's 8,717 respondents are proof that it struck a chord with the developer community – and the much higher participation rate from women in particular (compared to previous surveys) shows that there was demand for something that focused on these less-discussed issues.

      While you browse the data, make sure to also check out the many comments (<span class="icon-inline icon-inline-comment"/> icon) left by respondents as they took the survey, in which they share their personal stories and thoughts in much more detail.

      With all this out of the way, please enjoy the results from the first ever State of Devs survey!

  # Takeaways

  - key: career.discrimination_issues.takeaway.devs2025
    t: |
      While we often think of discrimination in terms of gender or race, the most common reported factor was actually age, something that eventually affects all of us. 

      Breaking down the data by age range reveals that age discrimination becomes especially prevalent after 50 years old.

  - key: career.negative_impacts.takeaway.devs2025
    t: |
      Among all respondents, non-confrontational approaches such as avoiding colleagues, changing your behavior, or even resigning were the most common coping strategies in response to workplace issues. 

      The data also clearly shows the impact of gender, with women and non-binary respondents as a whole suffering each negative impact at a higher rate than men.

      Race and ethnicity on the other hand did not seem to have a similarly clear-cut impact. In fact, slightly *fewer* non-white respondents reported having resigned or sought therapy due to workplace issues – although further research would be needed to determine if this is because they didn't feel that need; or because they did but weren't in a position to do so.

  - key: workplace.job_title.takeaway.devs2025
    t: |
      As seen in other surveys, being an engineer is correlated with higher income compared to “just” being a developer.

  - key: workplace.income_evolution.takeaway.devs2025
    t: |
      Despite fears of an industry downturn, only 9% of respondents reported having seen their income decrease over the past year. 

      Interestingly, the larger the respondents' company, the more likely they were to report an income increase.

  - key: workplace.job_finding_application_count.takeaway.devs2025
    t: |
      While respondents needed a median of 4 job applications to find their current job overall, that number decreased as respondents' years of experience went up. 

      That being said, a slight increase was present at the higher end of the experience curve, which could be explained by age discrimination, or by out-of-date skills making the job search harder.
