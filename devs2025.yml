      2025 is a weird time to be a developer. AI is threatening to make us obsolete, we're dealing with mass layoffs, and there's an ongoing political vibe shift in some corners of the tech community. 

      So while asking about your favorite JavaScript framework over and over again is all well and good, we thought it was time to take on the bigger questions to help make sense of the current moment: who are you? what do you do besides coding? and what do you believe and hope for?

      Welcome to this first ever State of Devs survey, where we ask about everything that's *not* code. 

      As usual, every question is optional, so feel free to skip any that you don't feel comfortable answering. That being said we certainly hope you'll see value in this survey, and we can't wait to get to know you better!
