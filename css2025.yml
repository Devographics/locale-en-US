      There is only one item on my CSS wishlist for 2025: a slower pace!

      After years of rapid innovation, now feels like the right time for browser vendors to take a beat to consolidate, fix browser inconsistencies, and let the rest of us catch up.  

      After all, we might've heard about subgrid, `:has()`, scroll-driven animations, and all the other recent CSS improvements â€“ but how many of us can say that we've actually used all these features, let alone mastered them?

      This is why this year's survey will be so interesting. It'll be a chance to see which of the past few year's new CSS additions have already been adopted by the community, and which ones are still on our to-do list. 

      So once again, please join me for this year's State of CSS!
