  #     This might be the State of HTML, but this survey actually goes far beyond just HTML to encompass all areas of the web platform as a whole â€“ and there is *a lot* to cover!

  #     So as you might expect, designing a survey like this one always involves tough choices. This year, we decided to focus on new and upcoming features to help you stay up to date; as well as areas that browser vendors are most interested in.

  #     This means that your answers might end up having a direct impact on the roadmap of the browser you're using right now. Which is why I'm so excited to open this third edition of the State of HTML survey!
