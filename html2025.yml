    t: The 2025 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the HTML ecosystem.

  - key: general.html2025.survey_intro
    t: |
      In 2023, after the State of JS and State of CSS surveys had already been going on for a few years, we realized something was missing: what about the technology that brings it all together?

      After all, HTML now goes beyond tags and attributes, encompassing APIs for dynamic updates, rich embeds, performance hints, templating & components, and more. 

      The first State of HTML, led by web superstar [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) broke all previous records for a new survey with 21,000 respondents, and introduced new UI paradigms that improved all future surveys. 

      This year, with Lea back at the helm, we added ✨35 new features✨, and introduced two new sections: **Graphics & Multimedia** and **Performance**.

      What's more, as with previous editions, this year's results will be taken in consideration by browser vendors when deciding on their roadmaps, so participating can help shape the future of the web! 

      Are you ready? Get, set, go!

      If you want to get an idea of how capable the web platform has gotten over the past few years, look no further than the list of categories covered in this survey. 

      Forms, graphics, performance features, methods of interacting with various system and device APIs, accessibility… It's a wonder anybody is able to keep track of it all!

      Thankfully at least one person is: [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/), who after designing the original version of the survey in 2023, joined us again this year to give it an update. 

      And together, one of the areas we focused on this year was analyzing the vast quantity of freeform answers collected around various pain point areas. 

      You'll now be able to dig deeper into categorized data, as well as access (and search through) respondents' original answers.

      If nothing else, this should help us realize that we're all in this together, sharing the same frustrations- but also the same hopes!

  - key: accessibility.accessibility_techniques.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      While things like alt text or proper heading hierarchy have become second nature to most front-end developers, newer tools like the `prefers-` set of media queries have yet to truly become mainstream.

  - key: accessibility.accessibility_disabilities.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      It's nice to see that beyond accounting for users with vision impairments, more developers are also taking atypical color vision and mobility impairments into account compared to last year.

  - key: accessibility.accessibility_screenreaders.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      Once again, easily accessible tools like VoiceOver or the Chrome DevTools win over more specialized options. Although many developers still don't use screen readers of any kind (also note that 39% of survey respondents skipped the question altogether).

  - key: accessibility.accessibility_tools.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      Browser devtools have seen a huge jump in usage compared to last year's results, seeing them overtake Lighthouse to become the lead accessibility testing tool.

  # usage
  - key: usage.html_interoperability_features.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      There's always a bit of lag between the state of the web platform and actual real-world adoption, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the **Popover API** still tops the rankings. But make no mistake, this feature now officially has the "Newly Available" Baseline status, meaning using it across browser should be much less of an issue going forward.

  - key: usage.html_missing_elements.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      This year again **datatable** is the most requested new element. While it would certainly be nice to have built-in filtering, sorting, searching, etc. capabilities, it doesn't seem like something that will become a reality anytime soon. 

      On the other hand, progress is being made on other long-awaited features such as a native **switch** element, which explains its drop in the rankings.

  - key: usage.html_styling_issues.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      It will be no surprise that form inputs top the list of hardest elements to style. Thankfully, [customizable select elements](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/a-customizable-select) are in the works, even though [browser support](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features-explorer/features/customizable-select/) is still lagging.

  - key: usage.component_strategies.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      It's hard to dispute that JavaScript components have become the dominant paradigm of building UIs on the web. And yes, dealing with all these competing front-end frameworks can be messy–but it's a mess we know (and maybe even love?), a fact that makes it tough for web components to gain ground beyond fourth place.

  - key: usage.design_system_strategies.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      Design systems have become a requirement for most large-scale projects, and that fact is reflected in the popularity of all these various approaches.

  - key: usage.html_css_js_balance.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      As shown in the “Component Strategies” chart above, JavaScript is the de facto vessel for a lot of the HTML code we produce. Which explains why we spend so much time writing it!

  - key: usage.what_do_you_use_html_for.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      While the average survey respondents mainly works on dynamic web apps, many of us also spend time creating blogs or other text-heavy sites, harkening back to HTML's roots as a document-oriented language.

  # opinions

  - key: opinions.accessibility_is_valued.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      Given that lack of workplace buy-in is often cited as an obstacle to proper accessibility practices, it's nice to see that among survey respondents at least, things seem to be getting better, with both “agree” bars increasing compared to last year.

  - key: opinions.validation_is_important.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      It's easy to forget about HTML validation when dealing with the chaos of modern web development. But respondents agree that it remains an important part of the process.

  - key: opinions.keeping_informed_is_challenging.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      Despite great initiatives like [Baseline](https://web-platform-dx.github.io/web-features/), [keeping up with the web platform](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-keep-up-with-new-css-features/) remains a challenge. Hopefully this survey helps at least a little!

  - key: opinions.browser_interoperability_is_obstacle.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      It's not easy being a browser vendor in 2025. Developers complain about platform stagnation, so you introduce new features and APIs… only for developers to now complain about the lack of cross-browser support!

      This is why [Interop](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2025) has become a key part of the process over the past couple years. It gives browser vendors a chance to coordinate on feature compatibility, and avoid having all their hard work ruined by poor interoperability.

  - key: opinions.browser_interoperability_pace.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      The results of those interoperability efforts are reflected in this chart, with **75%** of respondents agreeing that things are moving at a faster pace than before.

  - key: opinions.web_platform_right_direction.takeaway.html2025
    t: |
      Similarly, **77%** of respondents have a positive opinion of the web platform's overall direction.
