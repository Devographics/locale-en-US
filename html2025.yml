    t: The 2025 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the HTML ecosystem.

    t: |
      In 2023, after the State of JS and State of CSS surveys had already been going on for a few years, we realized something was missing: what about the technology that brings it all together?

      After all, HTML now goes beyond tags and attributes, encompassing APIs for dynamic updates, rich embeds, performance hints, templating & components, and more. 

      The first State of HTML, led by web superstar [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) broke all previous records for a new survey with 21,000 respondents, and introduced new UI paradigms that improved all future surveys. 

      This year, with Lea back at the helm, we added ✨35 new features✨, and introduced two new sections: **Graphics & Multimedia** and **Performance**.

      What's more, survey results will be taken in consideration by browser vendors when deciding on their roadmaps, so participating can help shape the future of the web! 

      Are you ready? Get, set, go!

  #     Frontend development is the craft of creating good-looking, accessible, and readable websites.

  #     And on top of that it's also the art of architecturing complex apps with hundreds of components, complex state, and advanced data querying and caching.

  #     But it's *also* how you display 3D graphics, read and write to the filesystem, handle security issues, and improve performance.

  #     So with the web platform's ever-growing list of responsibilities, it makes more sense than ever to have this survey dedicated to HTML and all other web platform APIs, now in its third consecutive year.

  #     And to help us find our way through the fog, none other than web superstar [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) is back at the helm, having helped curate this year's questions–including 31 (!) new web platform features.

  #     And as with previous years, your answers will have a direct impact on the roadmaps of browser vendors. So once again, get ready to fill out this year's State of HTML survey!

  #     This might be the State of HTML, but this survey actually goes far beyond just HTML to encompass all areas of the web platform as a whole – and there is *a lot* to cover!

  #     So as you might expect, designing a survey like this one always involves tough choices. This year, we decided to focus on new and upcoming features to help you stay up to date; as well as areas that browser vendors are most interested in.

  #     This means that your answers might end up having a direct impact on the roadmap of the browser you're using right now. Which is why I'm so excited to open this third edition of the State of HTML survey!
