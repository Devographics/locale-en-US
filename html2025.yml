      Frontend development is the craft of creating good-looking, accessible, and readable websites. 

      And on top of that it's the art of architecturing complex apps with hundreds of components, complex state, and advanced data querying and caching. 

      But *also*, it's how you display 3D graphics, read and write to the filesystem, handle security issues, and improve performance. 

      With the web platform's ever-growing list of responsibilities, it makes more sense than ever to have a survey dedicated to HTML and all other web platform APIs, now in its third consecutive year. 

      And to help us find our way through the fog, none other than web superstar [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) is back at the helm, having helped curate this year's questions. 

      And as with previous years, your answers will have a direct impact on the roadmaps of browser vendors. So grab your beverage of choice, and get ready to fill out this year's State of HTML survey!

  #     This might be the State of HTML, but this survey actually goes far beyond just HTML to encompass all areas of the web platform as a whole â€“ and there is *a lot* to cover!

  #     So as you might expect, designing a survey like this one always involves tough choices. This year, we decided to focus on new and upcoming features to help you stay up to date; as well as areas that browser vendors are most interested in.

  #     This means that your answers might end up having a direct impact on the roadmap of the browser you're using right now. Which is why I'm so excited to open this third edition of the State of HTML survey!
