    t: The 2025 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the HTML ecosystem.

      In 2023, after the State of JS and State of CSS surveys had already been going on for a few years, we realized something was missing: what about the technology that brings it all together?

      After all, HTML now goes beyond tags and attributes, encompassing APIs for dynamic updates, rich embeds, performance hints, templating & components, and more. 

      The first State of HTML, led by web superstar [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) broke all previous records for a new survey with 21,000 respondents, and introduced new UI paradigms that improved all future surveys. 

      This year, with Lea back at the helm, we added ✨35 new features✨, and introduced two new sections: **Graphics & Multimedia** and **Performance**.

      What's more, as with previous editions, this year's results will be taken in consideration by browser vendors when deciding on their roadmaps, so participating can help shape the future of the web! 

      Are you ready? Get, set, go!

      If you want to get an idea of how capable the web platform has gotten over the past few years, look no further than the list of categories covered in this survey. 

      Forms, graphics, performance features, methods of interacting with various system and device APIs, accessibility… It's a wonder anybody is able to keep track of it all!

      Thankfully at least one person is: [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/), who after designing the original version of the survey in 2023, joined us again this year to give it an update. 

      And together, one of the areas we focused on this year was analyzing the vast quantity of freeform answers collected around various pain point areas. 

      You'll now be able to dig deeper into categorized data, as well as access (and search through) respondents' original answers.

      If nothing else, this should help us realize that we're all in this together, sharing the same frustrations- but also the same hopes!
