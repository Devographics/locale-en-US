      React has been around for a while now, and it's clear that it has become one of the dominant front-end frameworks. 

      Yet even so, React is still evolving at a fast pace, and the community is doing its best to keep up.  

      With the State of React developer survey, we are hoping to make sense of that evolution, and help developers find their way in the vast React ecosystem.

  - key: general.state_of_react.description

  - key: features.features_intro_react
    t: |
      Welcome to the survey! This first part is all about figuring out 
      which of the official React APIs you know about and use. 

      By the way, if you want to tell us more about any of your choices, just click that little "comment" icon!

  - key: tools.tools_intro_react
    t: |
      The next couple sections focus on the **libraries** and **frameworks** that make up 
      the React ecosystem. Let us know what you're excited about!
