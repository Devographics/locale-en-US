      Given that it originally came out of a company whose motto was “move fast and break things”, it's ironic that React's approach could be summarized as “slow and steady”.

      The React team has done a remarkable team of evolving the framework into its current modern state, progressively introducing innovations like Server Components and then letting the community adopt them (or not!) at its own pace.

      This year, it's time for the long-awaited Compiler to make its official debut. And things are also moving on the administrative front, with the recently-introduced [React foundation](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation).

      So whether you're on the cutting edge of new React features, or adopting innovations are a slower pace, join us once again to figure out where React is going by taking this year's State of React survey!

      Welcome to the survey! This first part is all about sharing your experience with various React features:


      - **Never heard of it**: it's your first time seeing this – or you've heard of it but have no idea what it does. 

      - **Heard of it**: you've read or learned about this, but haven't actually used it yet. 

      - **Used it**: you've used this at least once, even if it was just to play around. 


      By the way, if you want to tell us more about any of your choices, just click that little "comment" icon!
