      Given that it originally came out of a company whose motto was “move fast and break things”, it's ironic that React's approach could be summarized as “slow and steady”.

      The React team has done a remarkable job of evolving the framework into its current modern state, progressively introducing innovations like Server Components and then letting the community adopt them (or not!) at its own pace.

      This year, it's time for the long-awaited Compiler to make its official debut. And things are also moving on the administrative front, with the recently-introduced [React foundation](https://react.dev/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-the-react-foundation).

      So whether you're on the cutting edge of new React features, or adopting innovations at a slower pace, join us once again to figure out where React is going by taking this year's State of React survey!

  - key: features.features_intro.react2025
    t: |
      Welcome to the survey! This first part is all about sharing your experience with various React features:


      - **Never heard of it**: it's your first time seeing this – or you've heard of it but have no idea what it does. 

      - **Heard of it**: you've read or learned about this, but haven't actually used it yet. 

      - **Used it**: you've used this at least once, even if it was just to play around. 


      By the way, if you want to tell us more about any of your choices, just click that little "comment" icon!

      While there aren't any major surprises here, it's interesting to note that **Server Components** and **Server Functions** are the third and fourth most disliked features respectively, which is troubling for a set of new APIs that was supposed to pave the way towards React's next big evolution towards a more complete full-stack framework.

  - key: features.main_apis_ratios.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      React is a mature library, and that translates into fairly predictable usage curves for its main APIs.

  - key: features.hooks_ratios.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      When it comes to hooks, [useId](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) has been gaining adoption quickly. And while [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) is still one of the most-used hooks APIs, it's also the one with the lowest satifaction ratio, confirming many developers' issues with the hook's finicky reactivity model.

  - key: features.new_apis_ratios.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      While **Server Components** and **Server Functions** are both slowly growing in popularity, [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) is the new feature with the highest adoption rate. 


      It also boasts a high satisfaction ratio, which sadly isn't the case for the aforementioned server APIs.

  - key: features.main_apis_pain_points.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      `forwardRef` has long been the bane of React developers, which is why seeing it [deprecated in React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19#ref-as-a-prop) was such welcome news.

  - key: features.hooks_pain_points.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      Once again, React developers are coming through loud and clear with their annoyance at `useEffect`.

  - key: features.new_apis_pain_points.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      As foreshadowed by previous charts, respondents have their fair share of gripes with **Server Components**.

  - key: features.reading_list.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      The `<ViewTransition>` API may still only be available in React Canary, but it's already generating a lot of curiosity among respondents, along with `<Profiler>`.

  - key: libraries.all_libraries.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      **TanStack Query** garnered the most positive opinions overall, with **TanStack Start** not too far behind after **Zustand**, **shadcn/ui**, and **create-vite**.

      And echoing recent results from the [State of JavaScript survey](https://2025.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/), **Next.js** was the most commented-on library here as well.

  - key: libraries.tools_ratios_over_time.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      **shadcn/ui** stands out as the project with the fastest rise in usage, going from 20% to 56% in two years.

      Meanwhile, **TanStack Start** made big waves despite being a relatively new project, going from 55% to 81% awareness in just one year!

  - key: component_libraries.component_libraries_ratios.takeaway.react2025
    t: |
      While **MUI** (a.k.a. Material UI) is still number one in terms of usage, **shadcn/ui** is growing fast and on the verge of overtaking it for the top spot.
