    t: The 2022 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the HTML ecosystem.

  - key: introduction.html2023
    t: >
      While JavaScript was taking over the web, and CSS was gaining new superpowers year over year, 
      it could seem like HTML was content to stay dormant, happy to cede center stage to its younger siblings. 
      After all once you've learned about `<div>`s and `<h>`s 1 through 6, what else is there to know?


      Quite a lot, as it turns out! Once again we drafted [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) to put her in-depth
      knowledge of the web platform to work, and help us craft a survey that ended up reaching far
      beyond pure HTML to cover accessibility, web components, and much more.


      This partly explains why this report has taken so long to come out – there was 
      just a *lot* of new data to process! Hopefully you'll find that the result was worth the wait.


      Beyond the data included here, we've also improved our **chart customization** feature to let you tailor 
      each data visualization to an even greater degree. If you find any interesting
      insights in the process, be sure to let us know!


      You can learn more about all this in [this post](https://dev.to/sachagreif/discover-the-state-of-html-2023-survey-results-n10), or by watching a [quick YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-rFwp2zUT4)


      With all this out of the day, welcome to the results for the first ever State of HTML survey. 
      After this, I'm willing to bet you won't look at good old HTML quite the same way ever again!

      ## Support the Survey With the State of HTML T-Shirt

      Do you miss the the good old days of the mid-90s, when HTML was king and VHS tape covers featured futuristic, colorful artwork? 

      The bad news is that even with 2024's technology, you can't yet go back in time to relive those glory days. But what you *can* do is wear this awesome original retro t-shirt, designed by none other than the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen.

      *Phew!* This survey has taken a monumental effort by dozens of people across six continents. Not only did it set a new record for the most responses in a “State of…” survey debut, the data collection UIs we pioneered gave us unparalleled insight into developer attitudes.


      Some argue that improving HTML is futile, but the survey resoundingly demonstrates the contrary. **Developers crave more interactive HTML elements**: not only were interactive elements like `<datalist>` or the Popover API among those accumulating the most positive sentiment across all categories, but interactive widgets also topped the wishlist for [missing elements](https://2023.stateofhtml.com/en-US/usage/#html_missing_elements). 


      However, **making simple things easy** by providing canned functionality is no longer sufficient. Making complex things possible by supporting thorough customization is a necessity: insufficient customizability, especially around **styling**, was by far the top recurring pain point. 


      As a result, form elements were also those [most frequently recreated](https://2023.stateofhtml.com/en-US/usage/#html_functionality_features); a lose-lose outcome that makes both developers and end-users suffer. Thankfully, there are many new initiatives to improve this, so the future looks bright.


      Another big need is **extensibility**. HTML only being evolved by standards bodies does not scale, and projects have specific needs that cannot be addressed by generic elements. Unfortunately, **Web Components APIs**, while widely used, still fall short at effectively addressing developer pain points, and topped the charts of worst experiences across the entire survey. However, the ongoing activity in this area (some of which I have been a part of) leaves me hopeful that while it has been a rocky path, they will reach their full potential in the end.


      Which brings me to my final point: it is important to remember that this survey only captures developer perspectives at a specific moment in time. I cannot wait to see how the data evolves! So I hope you will join us soon for the survey’s second iteration, so we can gain insight on the trend of all this over time.
