    t: The 2022 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the HTML ecosystem.

  - key: introduction.html2023
    t: >
      While JavaScript was taking over the web, and CSS was gaining new superpowers year over year, 
      it could seem like HTML was content to stay dormant, happy to cede center stage to its younger siblings. 
      After all once you've learned about `<div>`s and `<h>`s 1 through 6, what else is there to know?


      Quite a lot, as it turns out! Once again we drafted [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) to put her in-depth
      knowledge of the web platform to work, and help us craft a survey that ended up reaching far
      beyond pure HTML to cover accessibility, web components, and much more.


      This partly explains why this report has taken so long to come out – there was 
      just a *lot* of new data to process! Hopefully you'll find that the result was worth the wait.


      Beyond the data included here, we've also improved our **chart customization** feature to let you tailor 
      each data visualization to an even greater degree. If you find any interesting
      insights in the process, be sure to let us know!


      With all this out of the day, welcome to the results for the first ever State of HTML survey. 
      After this, I'm willing to bet you won't look at good old HTML quite the same way ever again!

      ## Support the Survey With the State of HTML T-Shirt

      Do you miss the the good old days of the mid-90s, when HTML was king and VHS tape covers featured futuristic, colorful artwork? 

      The bad news is that even with 2024's technology, you can't yet go back in time to relive those glory days. But what you *can* do is wear this awesome original retro t-shirt, designed by none other than the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen.

    t: >
      HTML has gone through a real hero's journey over its existence. Born as a humble document description language, it soon evolved into something much more powerful, receiving its own content styling features and interaction capabilities. 


      But as the web grew, CSS and JavaScript came out from HTML's shadow and both grew much more powerful than poor HTML could ever dream of, and relegated it to a secondary role. 


      Yet over the years, web developers have grown disillusioned with having to reimplement the same basic components over and over again. While some have put their faith in JavaScript frameworks, and other wait for the promised Web Components Era, others yet are wondering if maybe the solution wasn't under our eyes all along. Could it be HTML's time to shine again?


      Browser vendors certainly seem to think so, with many new elements and APIs having been introduced over the last couple years – and many more yet to come. 


      And while this initial State of HTML has been quite instructive, I personally can't wait to see how the data evolves. So I hope you'll join us next year (or rather, this year!) as well, and come along HTML's next adventure!
