    t: The State of JS 2022 survey is currently open, you can [go take it right now](https://survey.devographics.com/survey/state-of-js/2022?source=css2022)!

    t: |

      I'm not going to lie, keeping up with CSS hasn't been easy lately. Thankfully this year [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) took the lead of the survey design process, building on the work done by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) last year.

      We were also lucky enough to get support from the Google Chrome team, who (along with other browser vendors) uses these results to help guide their roadmap.

      Thanks to all that extra help, we were able to introduce a bunch of new features, starting with the ability to **customize charts**. By clicking the <span class="customize-chart-icon">“settings”</span> icon next to a chart, you can now filter it by salary, country, or any other variable you'd like!

      With all this out of the way, let's see how CSS evolved in 2023!

      <span class="first-letter">C</span>SS is going through a period of unprecedented progress. Between `:has()`, container queries, subgrid, and many more, new features are making their way to browsers seemingly every month. 

      The consequence of all this growth is that things can get a bit overwhelming. Thankfully this year we had [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) to help design the survey and guide us through the CSS jungle. 

      And speaking of the survey, did you know browser vendors use its data as part of the [Interop](https://web.dev/interop-2023/) initiative to help prioritize which features to work on next?

      Finally, we are introducing a new feature this year: the ability to **customize charts** with your own data filters. We're excited to see what kind of new insights you'll come up with!

      Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes.

  # Conclusion
  ###########################################################################

  - key: conclusion.css2023
    t: |
      <span class="first-line">As usage of newer CSS features has been trending upwards, usage of CSS frameworks has been on a downward slope.</span>

      This could be an indication that folks are starting to get used to the idea that you don’t necessarily have to wait to use newer CSS features, because browsers will catch up a lot quicker than before.

      With high awareness of native CSS features like nesting and `:has()` (which can act like a parent selector, but is much more than that!), it seems like we are on the brink of widespread adoption.

      Out of all these features, I did have a personal favourite for this year, and that is `text-wrap: balance`. It provides a one-line fix for a request that I’ve constantly gotten over my entire web development career: “can we adjust that headline so the last word isn’t an orphan?”

      It was also interesting that so many developers felt that animating to auto and masonry layout were missing CSS features. It's true it's always been tricky for browsers to determine element dimensions (especially height) when they're not explicitly declared. 

      But as [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) mentioned last year, with initiatives such as [Interop](https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023) bringing browsers together, features thought previously impossible can now potentially become reality!

  - key: about.content
    t: >
      The 2023 State of CSS survey ran from June 15 to July 15 2023, and collected 9,108 responses. The survey is run by [Devographics](https://www.devographics.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 


      The State of CSS logo and t-shirt were designed and animated by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).


      ### Survey Goals

      This survey, along with the [State of JavaScript](https://stateofjs.com/) survey, was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 


      As such, these surveys are focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 


      Additionally, survey data is also used by browser vendors to prioritize features and inform initiatives such as [Interop 2023](https://web.dev/interop-2023/).


      ### Survey Design

      This year, survey design was lead by [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) thanks to a funding grant from the Google Chrome team. All survey questions were optional. 

      ### Survey Audience

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

      ### Project Funding

      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - **T-shirt sales**. 

      - **Sponsored Links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

      - **Sponsored Charts**: starting last year, anybody can now also choose to directly sponsor a chart for $10 or more, and get their Twitter avatar displayed next to it.

      - **Google**: this year, the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a budget to hire Lea to help design the survey, as well as funded me directly to help support my work. 

      - **Nijibox**: Japan-based [Nijibox](https://nijibox.jp/) has also graciously accepted to sponsor my efforts to help make these yearly surveys more sustainable. 


      ### Technical Overview

      You can find a more in-depth technical overview of how the surveys are run [here](https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-the-devographics-surveys-are-run-2023-edition-1p6a). Our code is [open-source](https://github.com/Devographics/Monorepo/).
