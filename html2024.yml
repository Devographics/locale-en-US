    t: The 2024 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the HTML ecosystem.

  - key: general.html2024.survey_intro
    t: |

      HTML was the original web technology, and the fact that it's more relevant than ever three decades later is kind of amazing. 

      But despite its name, this surveys goes far beyond just HTML to encompass all areas of the web platform as a whole – and there is *a lot* to cover! 

      So as you might expect, designing a survey like this one always involves tough choices. This year, we decided to focus on new and upcoming features to help you stay up to date; as well as areas that browser vendors are most interested in.

      This means that your answers might end up having a direct impact on the roadmap of the browser you're using right now. Which is why I'm so excited to open this second edition of the State of HTML survey!

      Welcome to the survey! This first part is all about sharing your experience with various web platform features:


      - **Never heard of it**: it's your first time seeing this – or you've heard of it but have no idea what it does. 

      - **Heard of it**: you've read or learned about this, but haven't actually used it yet. 

      - **Used it**: you've used this at least once, even if it was just to play around. 


      By the way, if you want to tell us more about any of your choices, just click that little "comment" icon!

      <span class="first-letter">D</span>espite its name, this survey is about a lot more than just HTML. 

      Don't get me wrong – HTML itself is more relevant than ever today, which is quite impressive for a 30-year old technology. Even so, we've  tried to broaden the survey's scope even more to the web platform as a whole.  

      From browser APIs, to web development pain points, to accessibility strategies, to analytics and performance tools, there's a *lot* to cover. 

      And if you find all this raw data a bit lacking in context, you can now also browse through the **comments** left by respondents on each question. 

      So let's dive right in and see what the web platform has been up to in 2024!

      ## Support the Survey With the State of HTML T-Shirt

      Do you miss the the good old days of the mid-90s, when HTML was king and VHS tape covers featured futuristic, colorful artwork? 

      The bad news is that even with 2024's technology, you can't yet go back in time to relive those glory days. But what you *can* do is wear this awesome original retro t-shirt, designed by none other than the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen.

      *Phew!* This survey has taken a monumental effort by dozens of people across six continents. Not only did it set a new record for the most responses in a “State of…” survey debut, its data collection UI pioneered innovations that gave us unparalleled insight into developer attitudes, and will ripple far beyond its scope. 


      Some argue that improving HTML is futile, but the survey resoundingly demonstrates the contrary. **Developers crave more interactive HTML elements**: not only were interactive elements like `<datalist>` or the Popover API among those accumulating the most positive sentiment across all categories, but in addition all top [missing elements](https://2024.stateofhtml.com/en-US/usage/#html_missing_elements) were interactive widgets. 


      However, **making simple things easy** by providing canned functionality is no longer sufficient. **Making complex things possible** by supporting thorough customization is a necessity: insufficient customizability, especially around **styling**, was by far the top recurring pain point. 


      As a result, form elements were also the elements [most frequently recreated](https://2024.stateofhtml.com/en-US/usage/#html_functionality_features); a lose-lose outcome that makes both developers and end-users suffer. Thankfully, there are many new initiatives to improve this, so the future looks bright.


      Another big need is extensibility. It does not scale if only standards bodies have the privilege to extend HTML; and besides, generic elements cannot possibly address the enormous diversity of needs. Unfortunately, **Web Components APIs** (and especially Shadow DOM), while widely used, appear to fall short in terms of meeting developer needs and providing a smooth developer experience, as they topped the charts of worst experiences across the survey. However, the ongoing activity in this area (some of which I have been part of) leaves me hopeful that while it has been a rocky path, they are on track to reach their full potential.


      Which brings me to my final point: it is important to remember that this survey is only a snapshot of developer perspectives and reflects the state of the web platform at the time. However, a primary goal of these surveys is to improve the status quo by providing better visibility into developer needs. How many of today’s pain points will be addressed tomorrow as a result? Join us later this year for the survey’s second iteration and let’s find out!

  - key: about.content
    t: |
      The 2024 State of HTML survey ran from September 19 to October 19 2024, and collected 20,904 responses. 

      The survey design effort was lead by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) thanks to a grant from Google. Lea also oversaw the prototyping, testing, and implementation of new UI data collection elements; contributed to data processing; and helped with data visualization. 

      The survey infrastructure is run by [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/) and [Eric Burel](https://www.lbke.fr/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 

      This year's logo and t-shirt were designed by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).

      ### Survey Goals

      This survey was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 

      As such, the survey is focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 

      It should also be taken as a **snapshot of a specific subset of developers**, and is not meant to speak for the entire ecosystem. 

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way.

      ### Project Funding

      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - **T-shirt sales**. 

      - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

      - **Other Funding**: [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) also funded work on the survey.
