    t: >
      JavaScript, you OK? You've barely created any new front-end frameworks this year.


      After a decade of rapid iteration, it seems clear that the ecosystem has stabilized over the last few years. For example, did you know that “newcomer” Svelte is *9 years old*? Which, in JavaScript framework years, is basically ancient!


      Instead, the main battle has moved to the realm of meta-frameworks, with Astro making a serious attempt at Next.js's crown – while over in build-tool land, it seems only a matter of time until Vite overtakes webpack. 


      Or maybe something else entirely will appear out of the Rust ecosystem and suddenly take over, bringing a premature end to our well-deserved era of peace and quiet.  


      Whatever happens, one thing's for sure: you can help us figure it all out by taking this year's State of JavaScript survey!
