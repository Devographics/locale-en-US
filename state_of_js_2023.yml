      <span class="first-letter">I</span>t should be clear by now that, for better or for worse, JavaScript is not slowing down. 

      Between server components, server actions, signals, compilers, and more, we're seeing new innovations pop up faster than most of us can handle. 

      The trick to avoiding the dreaded JavaScript fatigue is remembering that you can pick your lane: sure, you can live life on the cutting edge with the early adopters; but you can also keep a slower pace and focus on stable, mature technologies – and eventually get to the new hotness once it's had a couple years to cool down. 

      Speaking of taking it slow, you might be wondering why these 2023 survey results are being released six months into *2024*. The truth is, between launching the new [State of HTML](https://2023.stateofhtml.com/) survey, innovating new question formats, collecting more freeform data than ever, and rewriting a lot of our data visualization codebase, we ended up with a workload that was probably a bit too ambitious, to say the least. 

      Hopefully the result of all this extra effort will be worth it though. And we do plan on much faster turnarounds going forward. 

      With all this out of the way, let's discover what JavaScript has been up to lately!

      ## Support the Survey With the State of JavaScript T-Shirt

      Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes. 

      But now, thanks to the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen you can enjoy all this retro radness while also celebrating your love for JavaScript at the same time!

      This year, **23,540** respondents took part in the survey. And in order
      to help highlight different voices and surface deeper insights, we made a special
      effort to provide new ways to break our data down.

  - key: sections.features.description
    t: |
      JavaScript may move fast, but it seems like JavaScript developers move even faster, as many relatively new features already show high adoption levels.

  - key: sections.technologies.description
    t: |
      This year's results point to a high degree of fragmentation in the JavaScript world. But while this can sometimes cause headaches, all that competition does make for a very dynamic ecosystem.

  - key: sections.tools_others.description
    t: |
      Picking a technology can often come down to a series of tough choices between 
      competing priorities, and this year we tried to capture this process using a new bracket-style question format.

  - key: sections.environments.description
    t: |
      Accessibility has long been an after-thought when it comes to web development, but many developers
      are now realizing that it should in fact be the foundation on which everything else rests.

  - key: sections.resources.description
    t: |
      Rather than provide predefined lists of options for survey respondents to pick from, we decided to simply offer raw text fields. This led to quite a few new entrants in this year's Resources section!

  - key: sections.opinions.description
    t: |
      Whether it's pain points that hold you back today, or missing features that you hope to use
      tomorrow, this was your chance to vent and share your gripes with JavaScript!

        - **2**: High usage, high retention. Safe technologies to adopt.

        - **3**: Low usage, low retention. Technologies that are harder to recommend currently.

        - **4**: High usage, low retention. Reassess these technologies if you're currently using them.

  # Conclusion
  ###########################################################################

  - key: conclusion.js2022
    t: |
      <span class="first-line">JavaScript and TypeScript are more vibrant than ever.</span> 

      We saw a continuation of performance-lead innovations, many in reactivity and hydration (or the lack thereof). For example, [Svelte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao) took on simplicity in developer ergonomics and leaned into the compiler. Solid’s explored [new approaches to reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iK9zzhSKo4), while Qwik [shifted our mental model with resumability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zddw6qy5pf0). 

      Innovation is also exciting to see in multi-platform solutions like Tauri, Ionic and Flutter, which opens the door to see applications that span across even more platforms.

      We see globally distributed talent- like Nigeria and now India [having the highest developer growth on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/global-tech-talent). Around the world, there are amazing projects like Segun Adebayo's [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or Liyas Thomas's [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), and folks supporting other people’s growth and learning like Ada Nduka Oyom who founded [SheCodeAfrica](https://shecodeafrica.org/), a non-profit organization that has helped empower over 17K women across Africa.

      When we look at established frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue we often see a drop in satisfaction, and people may wonder what it means for the future. I believe that this decline is a function of the tool being battle-tested and used in production, of finding the rough edges and experiencing the trade-offs every tool has. It’s a sign of maturity and clear-eyed appreciation for what these tools can offer. They will also learn from innovation in the space and continue to evolve.

      Finally, I couldn’t be happier to see Vite’s absolute resounding presence in the award section for the second year in a row. Build and serve tech is truly making massive strides and we all benefit from this hard work. Bravo!

      The 2023 State of JavaScript survey ran from November 22 to December 12 2022, and collected 23,540 responses. The survey is run by [Devographics](https://devographics.com/), a collective consisting of me ([Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/)) and [Eric Burel](https://www.lbke.fr/), as well as invited experts and open-source contributors. 

      The State of JavaScript logo and t-shirt were designed by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).

      ### Survey Goals

      This survey was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 

      As such, the survey is focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why features or technologies may sometimes be omitted even if they are currently widespread 

      It should also be taken as a **snapshot of a specific subset of developers**, and is not meant to speak for the entire ecosystem. 

      ### Survey Design

      The survey was designed in part based on last year's survey, with an open feedback period where the survey outline was discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22State+of+JS+2022%22). 

      All survey questions were optional. 

      ### Survey Audience

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

      Note that frameworks, libraries, etc. were free to encourage their audience to participate in the survey and some of them did take advantage of this via banners, tweets, etc. A detailed breakdown of traffic sources is included in the "Sources" chart. 

      ### Project Funding

      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - **T-shirt sales**. 

      - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partners [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) and [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/).

      - **Direct Funding**: this year, [Google](https://www.google.com/) funded my work on the survey. 

      Any contribution or sponsorship is greatly appreciated. we would especially like to work closely with more browser vendors, since they play such a central role in the web ecosystem.  

      ### Technical Overview

      You can find a more in-depth technical overview of how the surveys are run [here](https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-the-devographics-surveys-are-run-2023-edition-1p6a).
