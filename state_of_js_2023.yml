      <span class="first-letter">A</span>fter years of relative stability, many are now beginning to question the status quo. 

      New front-end frameworks like Solid and Qwik are suggesting that React might not have all the answers after all, and on the server Astro, Remix and Next.js (among others) are making us reconsider how much code we really need to ship to the client. 

      We'll need all the data we can get if we want to make sense of all this, and in fact this year's survey received a massive **39,472** responses, almost double last year's amount! 

      Because of this newly expanded audience you might notice some unexpected results, such as some features going down year-over-year in terms of awareness or usage. 

      But having more data can potentially mean new insights, and that's why we've developed two new ways to interact with our dataset: the **Data Explorer** lets you cross-reference two variables and highlight any outlying results; while **Chart Filters** let you filter specific charts by income, country, gender, and many other demographic variables. 

      We've also replaced our catch-all "back-end" category with a more specific **Rendering Frameworks** page and added a new **Video Creators** list to the Resources section. 

      Finally, Features and Libraries questions also now have a **Comments** popup that lets you see what people actually think of the items mentioned in the survey!

      With all this out of the way, let's discover what JavaScript has been up to in 2022!

      ## Support the Survey With the State of JavaScript T-Shirt

      Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes. 

      But now, thanks to the talented Christopher Kirk-Nielsen you can enjoy all this retro radness while also celebrating your love for JavaScript at the same time!

      This year, **39,471** respondents took part in the survey. And in order
      to help highlight different voices and surface deeper insights, we made a special
      effort to provide new ways to break our data down.

      JavaScript may move fast, but it seems like JavaScript developers move even faster, as many relatively new features already show high adoption levels.

  - key: sections.technologies.description

      This year's results point to a high degree of fragmentation in the JavaScript world. But while this can sometimes cause headaches, all that competition does make for a very dynamic ecosystem.

  - key: sections.tools_others.description
    t: |
      Picking a technology can often come down to a series of tough choices between 
      competing priorities, and this year we tried to capture this process using a new bracket-style question format.

      Accessibility has long been an after-thought when it comes to web development, but many developers
      are now realizing that it should in fact be the foundation on which everything else rests.

      Highlighting blogs, podcasts, and sites was a good start, but this year we decided to go one step further
      and actually feature the people who make up the JavaScript community!

  # Conclusion
  ###########################################################################

  - key: conclusion.js2022
    t: |
      <span class="first-line">JavaScript and TypeScript are more vibrant than ever.</span> 

      We saw a continuation of performance-lead innovations, many in reactivity and hydration (or the lack thereof). For example, [Svelte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdNJ3fydeao) took on simplicity in developer ergonomics and leaned into the compiler. Solid’s explored [new approaches to reactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iK9zzhSKo4), while Qwik [shifted our mental model with resumability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zddw6qy5pf0). 

      Innovation is also exciting to see in multi-platform solutions like Tauri, Ionic and Flutter, which opens the door to see applications that span across even more platforms.

      We see globally distributed talent- like Nigeria and now India [having the highest developer growth on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/2022/global-tech-talent). Around the world, there are amazing projects like Segun Adebayo's [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), or Liyas Thomas's [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), and folks supporting other people’s growth and learning like Ada Nduka Oyom who founded [SheCodeAfrica](https://shecodeafrica.org/), a non-profit organization that has helped empower over 17K women across Africa.

      When we look at established frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue we often see a drop in satisfaction, and people may wonder what it means for the future. I believe that this decline is a function of the tool being battle-tested and used in production, of finding the rough edges and experiencing the trade-offs every tool has. It’s a sign of maturity and clear-eyed appreciation for what these tools can offer. They will also learn from innovation in the space and continue to evolve.

      Finally, I couldn’t be happier to see Vite’s absolute resounding presence in the award section for the second year in a row. Build and serve tech is truly making massive strides and we all benefit from this hard work. Bravo!

    t: |
      The 2022 State of JS survey ran from November 21 to December 22 2022, and collected 39,472 responses. The survey is run by [Sacha Greif](https://sachagreif.com/) and [Eric Burel](https://www.lbke.fr/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 

      This year's logo and t-shirt were designed by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).

      ### Survey Goals

      This survey was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 

      As such, the survey is focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 

      It should also be taken as a **snapshot of a specific subset of developers**, and is not meant to speak for the entire ecosystem. 

      ### Survey Design

      The survey was designed in part based on last year's survey, with an open feedback period where the survey outline was discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22State+of+JS+2022%22). 

      All survey questions were optional. 

      ### Survey Audience

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

      Note that frameworks, libraries, etc. were free to encourage their audience to participate in the survey and some of them did take advantage of this via banners, tweets, etc. A detailed breakdown of traffic sources is included in the "Sources" chart. 

      ### Representativeness & Inclusivity

      While we believe it's important to give a voice to every community, the reality is that an open survey like this one will always struggle to properly represent everybody, especially when operating through systems that already carry their own inherent biases. 

      In order to counter-balance this, we are implementing three distinct strategies:

      - **Outreach**: we always try to reach out to different organizations (such as BIPOC- or LGBTQ-focused organizations, or online teaching platforms) to try and diversify our own audience. 

      - **Data Analysis**: through features like facets and variants, we're always trying to make it easier to surface the voices of any demographic segment, no matter how minoritized it might be in our data. 

      - **Barrier Lowering**: making the survey too long, inaccessible, slow to load, English-only, etc. can all contribute to imposing an "effort tax" that cuts off the parts of the community that can't afford to pay it. Fixing these issues can lower the barrier to entry and in the process make our audience more diverse. 

      ### Project Funding

      Funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - **T-shirt sales**. 

      - **Chart Sponsorships**: members of the community can donate to the survey in exchange for having their name featured in the report.  

      - **Sponsored links**: the links to recommended resources at the bottom of each page are provided by our partners [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) and [RenderATL](https://www.renderatl.com/).

      - **Other Funding**: this year, [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Nijibox](https://nijibox.jp/) funded my work on the survey directly.

      Any contribution or sponsorship is greatly appreciated. I would especially like to work closely with more browser vendors, since they play such a central role in the web ecosystem.
