    t: The 2024 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the CSS ecosystem.

  - key: general.css2024.survey_intro
    t: |

      It's amazing to witness the speed at which CSS keeps evolving. While the past decade has been all about building a solid foundation for layout (Flexbox, Grid) and syntax (variables) the future promises to be about going much further than most of us ever dreamed of. 

      Want to calculate a square root or cosine in your CSS? Use that to build scroll-triggered animations? And maybe scope all of it down so it doesn't have any unwanted effects? Now you can do all that, and much more!

      Which is why this survey is more important than ever, not just as a way to keep track of your own progress; but also as a tool to let browser vendors know what we all think about this new direction.

      So once again, please join me for this year's State of CSS!

  - key: features.features_intro_css2024
    t: |
      Welcome to the survey! This first part is all about sharing your experience with various CSS features:


      - **Never heard of it**: it's your first time seeing this – or you've heard of it but have no idea what it does. 

      - **Heard of it**: you've read or learned about this, but haven't actually used it yet. 

      - **Used it**: you've used this at least once, even if it was just to play around. 


      By the way, if you want to tell us more about any of your choices, just click that little "comment" icon!

      <span class="first-letter">L</span>et me make a prediction: we'll look back at 2024 as the turning point between “CSS Classic” and “New CSS”.

      CSS Classic is how most of us have been writing CSS for years: using a limited set of features, and compensating for the language's limitations using outside tools such as libraries, pre- and post-processors, and strict methodologies. 

      New CSS on the other hand is an approach that embraces Subgrid, `:has()`, variables, container queries, and the many new and exciting CSS features introduced in recent years to not only do away with extra tooling, but even start taking on tasks that previously required complex JavaScript workarounds. 

      This is all possible thanks to a renewed comittment by browser vendors to, you know, actually *make this stuff work* – and I can't shake the feeling that we've barely scratched the surface of everything New CSS can offer.

      Between the bad video quality, the bulky cassettes, and having to rewind, there's not much to miss about the VHS era. But one thing we *do* miss are the amazing 90s visuals that used to adorn blank VHS tapes.

      Despite the many capabilities unlocked by CSS's new features, developers still rely on tooling and libraries to support their workflow, at least for now.

      While we often hear tales of six-figure salaries out of Silicon Valley, the reality is that most front-end developers throughout the world earn far less, as becomes apparent when directly comparing the U.S. and the rest of the world.

  - key: user_info.higher_education_degree.takeaway.css2024

      While having a degree will ensure you earn more, turns out it doesn't necessarily have to be related to programming – a good sign for the many among us who discovered a passion for web development further along in life.

  - key: user_info.gender.takeaway.css2024

      Canada, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. had the highest proportion of women respondents. 

      Our data also shows women's income to be lagging compared to other groups. While the reasons behind this are beyond the scope of this report, it’s clear that women in our industry do face some unique challenges.

  - key: user_info.race_ethnicity.takeaway.css2024

      Filter Effects (`blur()`, `contrast()`, etc.) were the unexpected most-used CSS feature of 2024, with 75.4% of respondents having used them; with the `:has()` selector a close second with 72.8%. 

      When ranking for sentiment on the other hand, Subgrid turned out to be the most loved feature, with 51.5% of respondents willing to use it again.

      The least-used feature? None other than `hanging-punctuation`, with 84.7% of respondents never having even heard about it!

  - key: features.reading_list.takeaway.css2024
    t: >
      The Reading List lets you save items you want to learn more about after the survey is complete. 

      So it's no coincidence that the least-known-about feature, `hanging-punctuation`, also tops our Reading List rankings as the item developers saved the most!

  - key: usage.css_js_balance.takeaway.css2024

      Even in the context of a CSS survey, it turns out a majority of respondents still spend most of their time in the JavaScript ecosystem. Only time will tell if this too will shift now that CSS is becoming more capable.

    t: >
      There are few worse feelings that knowing a new feature will solve your issue perfectly, yet not being able to use it because of poor browser support. 


      This is the case with Anchor Positioning, a promising new feature that is sadly not yet broadly supported.


      Container Queries on the other hand *are* [available at a baseline level](https://web.dev/blog/cq-stable) and ready to be used, despite showing up in many respondent's answers!

  - key: usage.css_missing_features.takeaway.css2024
    t: >
      In the absence of a magic wand that lets us conjure up any CSS feature we can dream of, the best we can hope for is that this data can help push browser vendors in the right direction!


      The good news: conditional logic, mixins, and masonry layouts are all currently being worked on in some form or another!

      <span class="first-line">Over the past two years, CSS has evolved so much</span> that keeping up with all the new features feels like a full-time job. This means there are many topics and ideas to explore and experiment with.

      For example, after being requested for years CSS `:has()` turned out to be one of the most powerful additions to CSS and significantly reduced the need for JavaScript. To me, it’s comparable to the transition from using CSS floats to Flexbox, which allowed us to create nearly any layout we could imagine.

      CSS **container size and style queries** are also game-changers for building components that need to work in different contexts. Currently, only size container queries have full support across all major browsers, though their adoption remains limited.

      Looking ahead to 2025, I hope to see wider usage of size container queries, full browser support for **scroll-driven animations**, style queries, and **anchor positioning**. What more could we ask for?

  #     Applying styles once an element becomes sticky or starts to overflow isn't a game changer persé, because it could've been achieved with JS before. But being able to achieve this without any JS is a great addition next to scroll driven animations and view transitions to bring the power of styling and animations back to CSS.

      The 2023 State of CSS survey ran from August 17 to September 12 2024, and collected 9,704 responses. The survey is run by [Devographics](https://www.devographics.com/), with help from a team of open-source contributors and consultants. 


      The State of CSS logo and t-shirt were designed and animated by [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](http://chriskirknielsen.com/).


      ### Survey Goals

      This survey was created to identify upcoming trends in the web development ecosystem in order to help developers make technological choices. 


      As such, this survey is focused on anticipating what's coming over the next few years rather than analyzing what's popular now, which is why the features or technologies that are currently most widespread are not always included. 


      Additionally, survey data is also used by browser vendors to prioritize features and inform initiatives such as [Interop 2024](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024).


      ### Survey Design

      This survey was designed collaboratively [on GitHub](https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/issues/245).

      ### Survey Audience

      The survey was openly accessible online and respondents were not filtered or selected in any way. Respondents were primarily a mix of respondents from past surveys (alerted through a dedicated mailing list) and social media traffic. 

      ### Project Funding

      Apart from t-shirt sales, funding from this project comes from a variety of sources:

      - Our partner [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) sponsors the survey in exchange for featuring relevant links to their courses at the bottom of each page.

      - The [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) team set aside a sponsoring budget this year to help design and run the survey.

      - [TokyoDev](https://www.tokyodev.com/) is also sponsoring the survey on an ongoing basis.
